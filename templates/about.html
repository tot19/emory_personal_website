    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Current Position</h2>
    <p>I am currently a Systems Engineer at Intercontinental Exchange. In this role, I work in a large, enterprise environment that is made up of on-premises Windows and Linux servers. My responsibilities include managing our HashiCorp Vault infrastructure and developing custom Python solutions for internal automation.</p>
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>My professional experience has largely been based around designing automation solutions in Python, Ansible, and Puppet. I have developed applications, scripts, and workflows that have saved thousands of hours of manual toil.</p>
    <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
    <p>Outside of work I enjoy exploring my current home of Tokyo, traveling, and  running with my wife. I have 2 cats - Francis and Gabriel - that are always up to no good.</p>
